#### What is Wellesley Query?

Wellesley Query is a webapp created using React, Javascript, HTML, and CSS. The idea behind it is to create a platform where people can ask questions and find answers about Wellesley College. This is open to anyone, current or incoming students, parents, professors, etc. Following the Honor Code at Wellesley, all the answers and questions should follow those guidelines.

#### Functionalities

Wellesley Query requires Google Authentication to be able to post questions or answers. On the main feed page, users are able to submit a question related to Wellesley College that will automatically get added to the feed without needing to refresh the page. Each question is posted anonymously, but the answers will show the user's Google username. Users can post multiple answers to the questions which will also show up on the page without needing to be refreshed. 

There is also a Nav Bar that has the Wellesley Query name, which brings you to the home page, Feed, which brings you to the feed page, and Honor Code, which has the Wellesley College Honor Code.

#### What I Learned From This Project

I learned and re-learned a lot from working on this project. After taking the Wintersession course in 2020, I had a pretty good understanding of React. I enjoyed working on this project so that I could re-learn React and put into use some of the things I learned from that course. I ran into some bugs occasionally but was able to overcome them by looking online or finding a loophole around them. I also learned a lot more about CSS through working on this project. I usually do not handle the aestetic parts of projects, so I found it very difficult but rewarding to work on the CSS code. I also learned a lot more about the steps it takes to deploy an app, how to keep private information safe, and how to use Google Authentication.
